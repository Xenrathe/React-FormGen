(For example, at 3rd level you would deal 15 ongoing damage against a single target.) As usual, a normal save (11+) ends the damage. A critical hit doesn't double this ongoing damage.",

You've got to be on your feet to sneer at their attack and recover.",

Each time you successfully gain an extra action, the size of the die you roll increases by one step on the following progression: (d4), d6, d8, d10, d12, d20. If you get an extra action after rolling a d20, you canâ€™t get any more extra actions that battle.",
