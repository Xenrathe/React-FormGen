  "Further Backgrounding": {
    "Adventurer": "Add a total of 2 points to backgrounds you already have, or choose 2 points of new backgrounds that make sense for your character. You still can’t go over the 5-point-per-background maximum.",
    "Champion": "Add a total of 3 points to backgrounds you already have, or choose 3 points of new backgrounds that make sense for your character. You still can’t go over the 5-point-per-background maximum.",
    "Epic": "Add a total of 2 points to backgrounds you already have, or choose 2 points of new backgrounds that make sense for your character. These points can take one of your backgrounds over 5, to a maximum of 7."

  "Improved Initiative": {
    "Adventurer": "Gain a +4 bonus to Initiative checks."
  },
  "Linguist": {
    "Adventurer": "This allows you to speak enough arcana, dwarven, elven, gnomish, gnoll, goblin, orcish, and other standard humanoid languages to comprehend enough of what most other humanoids are saying or screaming during battle. You are not fluent in all these languages, no one will mistake you for a native speaker, and your vocabulary is adventurer-centric (heavy on words connected to danger rather than philosophy or emotions). You can also read enough to get by in all these languages.",
    "Champion": "You can speak, read, and write all the humanoid languages fluently. Stranger languages are no problem for you either. If someone is speaking it, you can figure it out."

  },
  "Rapid Reload": {
    "Adventurer": "Reloading a heavy crossbow now takes only a quick action. Reloading a hand or light crossbow is a free action."
  },
  "Reach Tricks": {
    "Adventurer": "Once per battle, tell the GM how you are using your weapon’s reach to perform an unexpected stunt with a reach weapon such as a longspear or halberd. To use the stunt, you must roll a 6+ on a d20."
  },
  "Ritual Casting": {
    "Adventurer": "You can cast any spells you know as rituals. Classes that are already ritual casters (cleric, wizard) don’t need this feat."
  },
  "Secret School Technique": {
    "Adventurer": "You have learned a secret technique lost in the present age. Pick one of your non-spell powers to benefit from this secret technique. You must name and describe this technique, and also specify a bonus effect for the technique. Once per battle, when the escalation die is 2+, you may execute this secret technique. This bonus effect is mostly cosmetic—it cannot always do extra damage, nor can it apply a condition in most circumstances. However, if you set up a good story in advance, then it encourages the GM to be lenient: so, if the big villain in this campaign arc is the heavily armored Dread Knight, then seeking out the secret lost technique of the armor-piercing mantis sword strike might be a good idea.\n\nFor example, take the classic fighter move carve an opening. Executed as fate-cutting strike, it might curse the foe with bad luck as you cut through their good fortune. As longbeard’s precise mattock, it might let you roll your relationship with a dwarf-aligned icon and increase your crit range bonus by +1 for every die that rolls a 5 or 6. As heavenly judgement, it might make your sword blaze with divine light, and make your next critical hit holy damage.\n\nAs usual for this sort of collaborative story-meets-mechanics rules, work with your GM to come up with something that’s evocative but not overpowering."

  "Strong Recovery": {
    "Adventurer": "When you roll recovery dice, reroll one of the dice and use the higher result. At 5th level, reroll two of the dice. At 8th level, reroll three."

  "Toughness": {
    "Adventurer": "You get additional hit points equal to half your baseline class hit points (rounded down). At 5th level, the total hp bonus increases to your baseline hp value. At 8th level, the total hp bonus increases to double your baseline hp value."
