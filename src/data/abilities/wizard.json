      "Base": "Every wizard can cast a handful of cantrips each day. You don’t have to memorize or choose them beforehand, you just cast them on the fly.\n\nWizards can cast a number of cantrips equal to their Intelligence modifier each battle. Each cantrip takes a standard action to cast as a ranged spell.\n\nOutside of battle, a wizard can cast about three to six cantrips every five minutes. The Cantrip Mastery talent speeds up cantrip casting.\n\nAt the adventurer tier (levels 1–4), cantrips with a standard duration last 10–60 minutes, plus 10 minutes per wizard level. The GM rolls and the wizard becomes aware that their cantrip is about to end a couple of minutes before it’s done.\n\nAt the champion tier (levels 5–7), most cantrips last 1–6 hours.\n\nAt the epic tier (levels 8–10), cantrips last between 2–12 hours."

      "Champion": "You can cast full rituals by using all your actions each round to focus on the ritual for 1d3 + 1 rounds.\n\nAs with standard rituals, your fast rituals are not meant to replace combat spells; they’re a means of acquiring and improvising wondrous magical effects rather than a means of inflicting damage and conditions."

      "Type": "Default",
      "Base": "When you choose spells during a full heal-up, instead of taking a standard spell, you can choose to give up a spell slot to memorize the utility spell at the same level. When you take the utility spell, you gain access to a range of useful non-combat spells of the level you memorized it or below. You cast each utility spell at the level of the spell slot you gave up for it. You can give up multiple spell slots to take utility spell multiple times.\n\nChoose from among the following utility spells:\n\n1st level: disguise self, feather fall, hold portal\nLevel 3: arcane eye, levitate, message, speak with item\nLevel 5: wall of stone, water breathing\nLevel 7: scrying",

      "Type": "Optional",
      "Base": "Cantrips are at-will spells for you. Unlike normal wizards, who use a standard action to cast a cantrip, you can cast a cantrip as a quick action.\n\nTo do something particularly cunning or surprising with one of your cantrips where the GM isn’t sure whether you could pull off that use of the spell, roll a normal save (11+) to cast the spell the way you envision it.\n\nAdditionally, you can expend a Level 3 spell slot or higher to choose one cantrip per spell slot you have given up and create a once-per-day related effect with it that is much greater, if you and your GM can agree on a cool effect that suits the cantrip.",
      "Adventurer": "You can use cantrip-style versions of any wizard spell you have memorized. When you expend a spell, however, you can’t make cantrip-style use of it any more.

      "Type": "Optional",
      "Base": "Once per battle, when you cast a spell that targets Physical Defense, before rolling for the number of targets or making the spell’s attack roll, you can expend your quick action to evoke the spell.\n\nHit or miss, you’ll max out the spell’s damage dice (except on a natural one, which deals no damage to the target and likely damages the caster in some manner).",

This doesn’t apply to spells that start as recharge spells. For example, at Level 7 when you have five Level 7 spells and four Level 5 spells, you could choose fireball twice as a Level 7 spell, or once as a Level 7 spell and once as a Level 5 spell.

Since these alternate spells are so lengthy, they take an additional quick action to cast.\n\nWhile the regular effects of the spells are the same as the more common versions, they have a small bonus effect appropriate to the situation.\n\nThe bonus effect is determined by the GM, or by a collaboration between the GM and the player. It should add to the storytelling power of the situation. The bonus effect should suit the name of the spell or the way it’s delivered, and shouldn’t precisely match up with what the spell normally accomplishes."

Your familiar is on your side but it’s not perfectly in your control.\n\nIf your familiar dies, it can come back to you the next time you get a full heal-up. (The method or story used is between you and the GM.) Alternatively, you can get a new familiar.\n\nFamiliars are useless in combat, except as indicated by their abilities.
