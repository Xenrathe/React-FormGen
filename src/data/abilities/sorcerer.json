    },
    "Breath Weapon": {
      "Type": "Default",
      "Base": "Spells with the breath weapon keyword have a chance to be re-used during battle. Each breath weapon spell lists the chance of re-using it (usually 16+). At the start of each round after you’ve cast the breath weapon spell, make the re-use roll. Success indicates that you may re-use that spell as a standard action, but for that round only. If you fail the re-use roll, you don’t have the option to re-use the spell, but you get another chance at the beginning of the next round. \n\nThe breath weapon power lasts for a single battle only. \n\nYou can have only one breath weapon spell active at a time. If you cast a different breath weapon spell when you have an earlier spell active, the new spell cancels the earlier spell. \n\nFailing a death save cancels any breath weapon spells you have active.",

    "Dancing Lights": {
      "Type": "Default",
      "Base": "All sorcerers can cast the dancing lights spell as a standard action. Unlike the wizard’s light cantrip, the sorcerer’s dancing lights spell produces a number of varicolored light globes that bloom within 5 to 30 feet of the sorcerer every two to five seconds. The sorcerer has very little control over the exact location or illumination provided by the lights, meaning that they can occasionally be used for dramatic plot purposes."

      "Type": "Default",
      "Base": "Some sorcerer spells deal damage of a random type. If it matters for the situation, use a d4 to determine which type of damage the spell deals.\n\n1 - Cold\n2 - Fire\n3 - Lightning\n4 - Thunder"
    },
    "Gather Power": {
      "Type": "Default",
      "Base": "Once initiative has been rolled and a battle is underway, a sorcerer can spend a standard action to gather magical power, preparing themselves for casting a double-strength spell with their next standard action. Gathering power is loud and very noticeable, but it does not itself count as casting a spell; you can gather power without taking opportunity attacks.\n\nIn addition, because you spend your standard action to gather power, you generate a small magical benefit. Like many of your powers, this benefit is chaotic rather than perfectly reliable, so you must make a random check to see what benefit you get. Roll a d6 and consult the appropriate table below.\n\nIf you get a benefit that deals damage to enemies, you can choose the type of damage (cold, fire, lightning, or thunder).\n\nChaotic Benefit, Adventurer Tier (levels 1–4): Roll (d6)\tEffect\n1-2\tYou gain a +1 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.\n3-4\tDeal damage equal to your level to all nearby staggered enemies.\n5-6\tDeal damage equal to your level to one nearby enemy.\n\nChaotic Benefit, Champion Tier (levels 5–7): Roll (d6)\tEffect\n1-2\tYou gain a +1 bonus to AC and Physical Defense until the start of your next turn.\n3-4\tDeal damage equal to your level + your Charisma modifier to all nearby staggered enemies.\n5-6\tDeal damage equal to your level + your Charisma modifier to one nearby enemy.\n\nChaotic Benefit, Epic Tier (levels 8–10): Roll (d6)\tEffect\n1-2\tYou gain a +1 bonus to all defenses until the start of your next turn.\n3-4\tDeal damage equal to your level + twice your Charisma modifier to all nearby staggered enemies.\n5-6\tDeal damage equal to your level + twice your Charisma modifier to one nearby enemy.\n\nAfter you have gathered power, you can use your next standard action to cast an empowered sorcerer spell. Empowered sorcerer spells deal double the damage of a normal sorcerer spell. This means that you double the damage results of the hit or a miss from the single spell. Non-attack spells generally don’t improve when cast empowered; use empowered casting for attacks.\n\nIf you do not or are not able to use your next standard action to cast a sorcerer attack spell, you lose the power you’ve gathered. You can use another standard action to gather power again, but the spell you eventually cast will still only do double damage.\n\nYou can spend your move actions and quick actions any way you like after you gather power and before casting your next empowered spell. Yes, once a battle has started it’s possible to perform the magical firefight trick of gathering power while hiding to the side of the cave entrance, then jumping into the cave opening on your next turn and blasting with the empowered spell.\n\nBreath weapon spells add an extra wrinkle. Of course you can gather power the first time you cast a breath weapon spell in a battle. Later in the fight it’s a question of whether you gathered power the turn before a breath weapon spell roll goes your way. You can be all ready with gathered power but roll too low to use the breath weapon spell, forcing you to cast a different spell with the gathered power.\n\nIf you’ve gathered power for a spell that deals ongoing damage, the ongoing damage is doubled the first time it is dealt, but not on subsequent rounds, if any.",
      "Adventurer": "Once per battle, you can choose the chaotic benefit you want instead of rolling for it.",

Infernal battery: Until the end of the battle, you can use a quick action once each round to make recharge rolls for your expended recharge spells. Each time you do so, you take damage equal to half the natural result of your recharge roll.\n3. Backlash: The first time you are staggered this battle, the enemy who staggered you becomes confused (save ends).\n4. Spell frenzy: You enter a spell frenzy (see Infernal Heritage talent). If you were already in a spell frenzy, you now roll 3d20 for each attack and take damage equal to triple the target’s level for each roll that misses.\n5. Fear aura: Enemies engaged with you that have fewer hit points than double your current hit points are dazed. They cannot use the escalation die.\n6. Teleport 1d3 + 1 times this battle: As a move action, you can teleport anywhere you can see nearby.\n7. Demonic speed: You can take an extra standard action each turn that the escalation die is even. You lose 2d10 hit points each time you use the extra action.\n8. Eye of the demon: Choose any two features you want. For the rest of this day, all your icon relationships disappear and are replaced by an identical number of conflicted points with a villainous icon (preferably one that is demonic)."
