# To-do List

- choosing / displaying of options (for ability such Mythkenner)
- access to other spell-lists
- responsive layout (tablet, mobile breakpoints)
- SpellInfo dynamically updates depending on level (big change in dataset, I think?)
- AbilitiesBlock sub-blocks borrows space from other sub-blocks to maintain formatting
- Alter character data based on feats, talents, etc (is a slog)
- clean up printing / don't break cards in half?
- Avatar upload / chooser somewhere
- Icon relationship modal / pop-up using image
- SorcererFamiliar has permanent / random button
