# To-do List

- Scrollbar maintain formatting
- SpellInfo dynamically updates depending on level (big change in dataset, I think?)
- Cantrips & Utility Spell implementation
- Too many familiar abilities error check
- AbilitiesBlock sub-blocks borrows space from other sub-blocks to maintain formatting
- AbilitiesBlock (pull from database / JSON files)
- Alter character data based on feats, talents, etc (is a slog)
- ItemsBlock (basic / write-in) OR put block into Narrative?
- Avatar upload / chooser somewhere
- Icon relationship modal / pop-up using image
